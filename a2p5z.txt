Below you will find a CSV with SMS messages. These are various kind of SMS including banking transactions, Airtel, Paytm, etc
WARNING: DO NOT UPLOAD THE SMS DATA CSV IN ANY PUBLIC SITE . THIS IS PRIVATE DATA

Using regular expressions you have to parse different types of messages. It is upto you to make regular expressions for maximum different types of messages.

After you parse these messages - you have to generate two things:
1. account balances for different types of accounts (for example HDFC, etc) 
2. total amount of transaction (debit + credit) for different types of accounts

We prefer that you do this in python, however we are completely ok if you do this in any other language.

to submit the solution, create a github account (unless you already have one) and create a repository called "mytest" in there. Upload the code there and send us the link
